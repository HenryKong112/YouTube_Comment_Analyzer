This analytical tool is designed for analyzing comments on YouTube videos using **VADER sentiment analysis** and **BERTopic** for topic modeling.

You can download YouTube comments as `.xlsx` or `.csv` files using the [YouTube Comment Extractor](https://github.com/HenryKong112/HenryKong112-YouTube-Comment-Extractor).
